            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                In chemistry, reactions don't always proceed to the end. Sometimes, they get stuck in the middle. This is called
                <b>equilibrium</b>, and it happens for reactions that occur in both directions. When a reaction is in equilibrium, the
                concentrations of the compounds remain the same. This is because the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the
                reverse reaction, so there is no net change in concentration.
            </p>

            <p>
                The rate at which a reaction occurs depends on the concentration of the reactants, the temperature of the reaction, the
                physical state of the reactants, and the presence of a catalyst. For the one-step reaction
                <span class="equation">
                    <i>n</i>A + <i>m</i>B &#8644; <i>p</i>C + <i>q</i>D
                </span>
                where A, B, C, and D are all gases or solutions, the forward rate can be written as
                <span class="equation">
                    k<sub>1</sub>[A]<sup><i>n</i></sup>[B]<sup><i>m</i></sup>
                </span>
                and the reverse rate as
                <span class="equation">
                    k<sub>2</sub>[C]<sup><i>p</i></sup>[D]<sup><i>q</i></sup>
                </span>
                Since the forward rate and the reverse rate are equal at equilibrium, the ratio of the reverse rate to the forward rate is
                one to one. From this, we can rearrange to find
                <span class="equation">
                    <span class="fraction">

                    </span>
                </span>
                The expression on the left is called the <b>equilibrium expression</b>, and the value on the right,
                <span class="fraction">k<sub>1</sub><line></line>k<sub>2</sub></span> is a constant, which we call the
                <b>equilibrium constant</b>, or K<sub>eq</sub>. The equilibrium constant does <b>not</b> depend on the concentration
                of any species in the reaction; it <b>does</b> change with temperature, however. Also, it is important to note that
                the equilibrium expression is only equal to the equilibrium constant when the reaction has reached equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, to find the equilibrium expression for a reaction, take the concentration of each of the products raised
                to the power of its coefficient and multiply them together, then divide by the concentrations of the reactants raised to
                the power of their coefficients. However, solids and pure liquids are <b>not</b> included in the equilibrium expression.
                If you wouldn't include something in the rate law, then don't include it in the equilibrium expression. If none of the
                products or none of the reactants are included, then use 1 for the numerator or denominator of the expression.

            <h1>Common uses for K<sub>eq</sub></h1>
            <p>
                Ok, we've seen that equilibrium reactions have equilibrium constants associated with them, but what are they good for?
            </p>
            <p>
                One use for K<sub>eq</sub> is to see which way a reaction will proceed. Given a reaction and the concentration of all its
                products and reactants, we can plug them in to the equilibrium expression. The result is <b>not</b> K<sub>eq</sub>, because
                the reaction is not at equilibrium. Instead, we call this value Q, the <b>reaction quotient</b>. We can compare Q to
                K<sub>eq</sub> to determine which way the reaction will go.
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Q &lt; K<sub>eq</sub></th>
                        <th>Q = K<sub>eq</sub></th>
                        <th>Q &gt; K<sub>eq</sub></th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Form products</td>
                        <td>At equilibrium</td>
                        <td>Form reactants</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                The reaction will always proceed in the way that makes Q approach K<sub>eq</sub>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another use for K<sub>eq</sub> is to calculate the amount of product formed by an equilibrium reaction. Given the initial
                concentrations of all species and the value of K<sub>eq</sub>, we can create a system of equations to solve for the final
                concentrations. For example, consider the following reaction:
                <span class="equation">
                    H<sub>2</sub>(g) + I<sub>2</sub>(g) &#8644; 2HI(g), &emsp; K<sub>eq</sub> = 2.9 &#0215; 10<sup>-1</sup> at 300K
                </span>
                If we start with [H<sub>2</sub>] = 0.100M, [I<sub>2</sub>] = 0.100M, and [HI] = 0.000M, we can create a <b>RICE table</b>.
                <table class="rice">
                    <tr>
                        <td><b>R</b>eaction</td>
                        <td>H<sub>2</sub>(g)</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>I<sub>2</sub>(g)</td>
                        <td>&#8644;</td>
                        <td>2HI(g)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><b>I</b>nitial</td>
                        <td>0.100M</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>0.100M</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>0.000M</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><b>C</b>hange</td>
                        <td>-<i>x</i></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>-<i>x</i></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>+2<i>x</i></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><b>E</b>quilibrium</td>
                        <td>0.100M - <i>x</i></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>0.100M - <i>x</i></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>2<i>x</i></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                Because we don't know how much of the reactants will be used, we use the variable <i>x</i> to represent the change in
                concentration. We do know the ratio of the changes from the balanced equation, so we can write all the changes in terms
                of <i>x</i>. To fill in the equilibrium row, we simply add the changes to the initial concentrations. Then, we can plug
                these values in to the equilibrium expression and solve for <i>x</i>.

                Systems at equilibrium are cool and all, but what happens when we alter them? <b>Le Chatelier's principle</b> can tell
                us the answer. It states that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, the system will shift its equilibrium
                position so as to counter the effect of the disturbance. This can be explained in terms of
                <b>kinetic molecular theory</b> by examining the effect that each disturbance has on the collisions taking place
                in the reaction, and how that affects the forwards and backwards reaction rates of the equilibrium reaction. Le
                Chatelier's principle can be applied to the following four factors.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	<b>Concentration:</b>
                    <p>
                        Adding or removing a reactant or product. If a chemical system is already at equilibrium and the
                        concentration of any substance in the mixture is increased (either reactant or product), the system
                        reacts to consume some of that substance. Conversely, if the concentration of a substance is decreased,
                        the system reacts to produce some of that substance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By adding more reactants or products to the reaction, the frequency of collisions between reactant or
                        product molecules increases. This gives more opportunities for the forwards or backwards reaction to
                        occur, speeding up the respective rate and shifting equilibrium the other way. Similarly, reducing the
                        concentration reduces the number of collisions and slows down the rate in one direction causing the
                        equilibrium to shift towards the slower rate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<b>Pressure:</b>
                    <p>
                        Changing the pressure by changing the volume. Reducing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium mixture causes
                        the system to shift in the direction that reduces the number of moles of gas. Increasing the volume of a
                        gaseous equilibrium mixture causes the sytem to shift in the direction that increases the number of moles
                        of gas. Note that changing the total pressure by adding a non-reacting gas to the system does <b>not</b>
                        affect equilibrium. This is because the partial pressure of the reactants and products remain unchanged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the partial pressures of the reacting gases are increased, the number of collisions for both
                        products and reactants increases, but it increases more for the side with more moles of gas. This
                        increases the reaction rate for the side with more moles of gas and causes the equilibrium to shift
                        to the other side. Decreasing the pressure has the opposite effect. Adding a non-reacting gas has no
                        effect because it changes the rate of collisions between both the reactants and the products by the
                        same amount, leading to no net shift.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Temperature:</b>
                    <p>
                    	Increasing or decreasing the reaction temperature. When the temperature of a system at equilibrium is
                        increased, the system reacts as if we added a reactant to an endothermic reaction or a product to an
                        exothermic reaction. The equilibrium shifts in the direction that consumes the excess reactant
                        (or product), namely heat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of all particles is higher, so the number of
                        collisions in which the particles have enough energy to react is higher. This speeds up the rate in both
                        directions, but the increase is greater for endothermic reactions than exothermic reactions so the
                        equilibrium shifts to consume heat. The opposite is true for decreasing the temperature.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Catalyst:</b>
                    <p>
                    	Adding or removing a catalyst. A catalyst increases the rate at which equilibrium is achieved but does
                        not change the composition of the equilibrium mixture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction so that more collisions are energetic
                        enough to react, but it does so equally in both directions. Both rates increase the same amount, so there
                        is no net shift in equilibrium.

                            Increasing the volume decreases the pressure, which favours the side with more moles of gas. In this

                            Decreasing the temperature favours the exothermic reaction. &Delta;H is positive so the reverse
                            reaction is exothermic and the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants.

            <h1>Industrial applications</h1>
            <p>
                For industrial processes, it is important to maximize the concentration of the desired products and minimise the
                'leftover' reactants. Le Chatelier's Principle and the principles of reaction kinetics can both be used to design the
                best reaction conditions to give the highest possible yield of product in an economic way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideas on 'economic production' are described in most detail for the Haber Synthesis of ammonia, but equilibrium and
                kinetic factors are continually mentioned in the other examples too.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Haber process, developed by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, is an artificial nitrogen fixation process and is the main
                industrial procedure for the production of ammonia today. The process converts atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to
                ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) by a reaction with hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) using a metal catalyst under high temperatures and
                pressures. Although the Haber process is mainly used to produce fertilizer today, during World War I it provided Germany
                with a source of ammonia for the production of explosives, compensating for the Allied trade blockade on Chilean saltpeter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="equation">
                    N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) &#8644; 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g), &emsp; &Delta;H = -92 kJ/mol
                </span>
                The Haber process incorporates
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a high temperature &#0151; about 450&#8451;</li>
                <li>a high pressure &#0151; about 200 atmospheres (200 times normal pressure)</li>
                <li>an iron catalyst</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The pressure and catalyst make sense in order to maximize ammonia output rate, just like what the le Chatelier's Principle
                states. However, the high temperature may seem odd because the reaction is exothermic. While a lower temperature would result
                in a higher concentration of ammonia at equilibrium, it would also dramatically slow down the rate at which equilibrium
                is reached. The temperature 450&#8451; happens to be a compromise between increasing the equilibrium concentration of
                ammonia while keeping the reaction rate fast enough to be practical.

                        Increasing the concentration of dinitrogen tetraoxide gas will make the reaction shift to the products,
                        increasing the amount of nitrogen dioxide present in the equilibrium mixture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The products side has more moles of gas than the reactants side, so the pressure should be decreased
                        to maximize the amount of nitrogen dioxide produced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the forward reaction is endothermic, performing the reaction at a high temperature will shift the
                        equilibrium to the products while also increasing the rate at which equilibrium is reached.

                        The addition of a catalyst will not increase the amount of product at equilibrium, but it will speed up
                        the reaction to produce nitrogen dioxide faster.
